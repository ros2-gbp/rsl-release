ros-kilted-rsl (1.2.0-1noble) noble; urgency=high

  * Remove devcontainer
  * Fix new clang-tidy warnings
  * Update Catch2
  * Ensure FindEigen3.cmake is not used (#126 <https://github.com/PickNikRobotics/RSL/issues/126>)
  * Eigen: Add NO_MODULE to find_package (#125 <https://github.com/PickNikRobotics/RSL/issues/125>)
    Work around RHEL 8 failure due to a faulty FindEigen3.cmake module being found
  * Hide symbols from shared libraries by default and support DLL creation
  * Fix static_string.cpp compilation with MSVC standard library
    std::array's iterator is a pointer in libc++ and libstdc++ so
    const auto* works fine. However the array iterator is not a
    pointer on MSVC so compilation fails. Removing the asterisk still
    results in a pointer type being used but causes a clang-tidy check
    to fail so we have to disable that.
  * Disable TRY macro tests on MSVC
  * Disable compiler warnings by default
    Unconditionally enabling -Werror is a heavy-handed approach and not
    ideal when shipping code to be used by many third parties. In fact
    it's even better to disable warnings by default since compiler
    warnings are not hard requirements. They're merely a development
    tool that developers should opt into.
